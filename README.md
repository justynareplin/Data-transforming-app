# Data-transforming-app
An application is an example of a data transformation process using functional techniques dealing
with issues such as control flow and error state.
Topics I have explored during creating this application:
• implementation of bussines logic with Scala
• type construction
• data validation
• railway pattern
• monadic chaining
• disjunctions
